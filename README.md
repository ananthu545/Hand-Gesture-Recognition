#Some_Gestures.py
 This code tries to count the number of fingers .
 Initially press R to confirm that you are ready.
 Then place your hand such that it covers all 6 blue boxes and press H.
 The code takes a histogram and uses back projection to identify your hand.
 Then it uses convex hull defect to find out number of fingers and displays it.
 The code is susceptible to false gestures as I haven't implemented lenght of fingers and centre of hand yet.
